# House Price Prediction

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as:

- GrLivArea (Above ground living area in square feet)
- BedroomAbvGr (Number of bedrooms above ground)
- FullBath (Number of full bathrooms)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

# Customer Segmnentation using K-means


This project is part of my internship at Credora and involves segmenting customers using K-Means clustering based on their income and spending behavior.

##  Features

- Unsupervised learning with K-Means
- Data scaling and preprocessing
- Elbow method for optimal cluster selection
- Cluster visualization using seaborn
- Cluster analysis and business insights

##  Dataset

Available on Kaggle: [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

##  Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies (`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

## Output

- Cluster visualization
- Group statistics
- Insights for business decisions
