- Used Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters (k=5)
- Applied K-Means algorithm

- Interpreted cluster patterns

## Key Results
- Identified 5 distinct customer segments
- Clear separation between low/high income and spending behaviors
- Useful insight for targeted marketing strategies

## Business Interpretation
